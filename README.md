# Bamazon
### * **You must have a working MySQL server for the Bamazon app to work** *
## How to use

### Download
To begin, download or clone the github repository to whatever computer you wish to run the Bamazon app. You can do this by clicking on the "Clone or download" button on the main page of the Bamazon repository

### Create bamazon_db
Copy and paste the contents of bamazon_db.sql into a MySQL query. Use the sample template for table rows in bamazon_db.sql to create your own products to store in the database. Once, this is done execute the whole script to create your database. I used MySQL Workbench to accomplish this and in MySQL Workbench the plain lightning bolt executes the entire script if nothing is selected.

### Check Database
You can check that your table has been generated by highligting and executing

SELECT * FROM products

in MySQL Workbench
and it will display the products in table format.

### Running Bamazon
Now that you have a running database, open your terminal window and cd into the directory you saved the repository.

![Terminal CD](/images/cd.png)

At this point you will need node.js installed, it can be found here : 
https://nodejs.org/en/

Now you can run *npm install* to bring in mysql and inquirer packages.

![npm install](/images/npm.png)

Lastly, you must alter the host, port, user, and password in bamazonCustomer.js to reflect your server.

Now run *node bamazonCustomer.js* in the terminal to run the Bamazaon app.

### Using Bamazon

Bamazon will first ask you to input a product ID number and the amount you wish to buy.

If the ID is invalid, it will tell you and ask you for ID and amount again.

If there is not enough stock for the purchase Bamazon will tell you insufficient stock and ask you for ID and amount again.

If the ID is valid and the product is in stock, Bamazon will tell you your total and ask y/n if you wish to confirm the payment.

No will end the app.

![Run No](/images/confirmno.png)

Yes will thank you for the purchase, update the stock of that product on the server, and end the app.
